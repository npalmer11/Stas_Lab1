```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1. Should you do a linear regression on this data? Explain.

Y <- c(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
X <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19)

  I would not 

```{r}

```







```{r}
Y_dv <- c(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
X_iv <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19)

some_data <- data.frame(Y_dv= c(10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10),
                        X_iv= c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19))


lm(formula = Y_dv ~ X_iv, data = some_data)

cor.test(some_data$Y_dv,some_data$X_iv)


```
